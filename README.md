## Description:

This repo involved creating an internet retail, aka e-commerce. I must include categories, products, and tags.

## Installation:

The developer must install mysql2, sequelize and dotenv packages prior running the index.js in the terminal.

## Usage:

This application is used to store products as inventory, search, update, and delete products per id. Categories and tags will have the same fucntions from CRUD.

## License:

## Contribution:

## Testing:

I used the terminal in VS Code to test my code. I also used console.log for callbacks to view what was being passed.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that building routes is very benefical to accessing data. I noticed typing my code rather than copying and pasting has accelerated my learning path.
